Packaging shows water damage on approximately 3 out of 15 boxes, likely due to exposure during border crossing delays.

However, our analysis shows this carrier has had 6 late arrivals in the past 2 months, indicating systemic scheduling issues rather than isolated weather events. Port operations also noted that Pacific Shipping frequently arrives without proper advance notice, causing additional bottlenecks in unloading procedures. Recommend implementing stricter SLA requirements and penalty clauses for repeat late arrivals."

Recommend phasing out TransMexico for critical shipments and implementing strict performance improvement requirements for continued partnership."
